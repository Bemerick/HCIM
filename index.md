  The President’s Management Agenda highlights the need for interoperable Human Capital (HC) systems that enable paperless data collection and exchange across the federal human capital information ecosystem. To realize this vision of modernizing federal human capital information collection and exchange, the Office of Personnel Management, Human Resources Line of Business (HRLOB) is modernizing human capital data standards into a Human Capital Information Model (HCIM). Aligning HC data collection and exchange needs with statutory, regulatory and policy guidance, the HCIM comprises the official standards for human capital data collection and exchange. The HCIM processes that produce the HCIM components establish HC data governance, management, and quality standards. Specifically, the HCIM consists of globally-defined metadata and information packages, which are used to standardize the collection and exchange of human capital data between federal agencies, federal shared services providers, policy-makers, regulators, academia, industry and the public.

The HRLOB champions the HC data standardization initiative by ensuring proper governance and coordinating the subject matter experts needed to inform and validate the development of the Federal HC Data Standard. As such, the HRLOB facilitates the Data Review Board (DRB), comprised of OPM executives, who provide the oversight and approval necessary to establish a transformative Federal HC data exchange standard. In coordination with the HRLOB, the DRB also adjudicates change requests from stakeholders so that the Federal HC Data Standard remains current with the needs of the business community. Additionally, the HRLOB partners with GSA’s Business Standards Council (BSC) to harmonize data standards across other lines of business (e.g. Travel, Financial Management, Grants) and promote Governmentwide adoption.
